We have our parent component that in this case manages a list of elements, a list of objects, and

we write a function to add a new object in a new item into our shopping list.

We pass down add item as whatever you want to call it as a prop to our form in the form.

When that form is submitted, we execute add item that takes the form data, sends it on up to this

function up here that updates the state in the parent, the state's updated.

We then see the new element show up here.

Okay so one tweak we could make that's really common is to empty out the form after you submit it,

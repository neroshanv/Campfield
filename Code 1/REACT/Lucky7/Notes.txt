Passing a function as a prop
- in JS, functions are first-class objects - you can pass them around
- we can pass a winCheck(dice) function to our LuckyN game

how data flows
- a parent component defines a function
- the function is passed as a prop to a child component
- the child component invokes the prop function
- the parent function is called, usually setting new state
- the parent component is re-rendered along with it's children
